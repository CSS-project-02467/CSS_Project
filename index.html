        <h1>Analyzing bot interaction on the Danish Wikipedia</h1>
        <h4>A project in Computational Social Science at the Danish Technical University</h4>
        <p>For many years now Wikipedia has been one of the most important sources of information
            on the internet, with millions of articles in all the world's major languages. Relying solely
            on the collaboration of strangers, Wikipedia has gone from being a radical experiment in free
            information to a trustworthy source of knowledge. As the project has grown over the years,
            automation has been vital in keeping articles up to date, making otherwise tedious edits,
            and empowering contributors to make the most use of what they have to contribute.
            We have taken a look at the bots that maintain and expand the Danish Wikipedia,
            and here present the results of our analysis of how they work together, and how
            network- and textual analysis can shed light on their contributions to the wiki.</p>
